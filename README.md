# LazyVim (but it's mine)

Welcome all. I'm moving away from Sublime (due to a lot of restrictions in its configuration and hookins.)
and I should probably get better at using Vim. Well, neovim. And I like Lua.

To use this, you'll probably want a nerd font of some type. The one in [my alacritty config](https://github.com/frothedoatmilk/alacritty) works well!
